/* Global styles or resets can go here */
/* Most base styles like body, font-family, background-color are now handled by shared-styles.css */

/* Retain any very specific global overrides or application-wide settings if necessary, */
/* but generally, shared-styles.css should be the primary source of global styling. */

/* For example, if you had specific root font-size settings or very specific resets not covered elsewhere: */
/*
html {
  font-size: 16px; // This could be kept if it's a deliberate choice not managed by shared-styles
}
*/

/* Ensure no conflicting body margin, padding, or background-color here */
/* Body styles are now in shared-styles.css */

/* Webkit font smoothing can be kept if desired, as it's a browser-specific enhancement */
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
