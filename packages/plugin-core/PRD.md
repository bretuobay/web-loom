# **Product Requirements Document: "Helios" Plugin Framework**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Helios** is a TypeScript-first, frontend framework-agnostic plugin framework designed to make web applications extensible, modular, and scalable. The core vision is to empower a host application to extend its functionality through self-contained plugins developed by internal teams or a third-party community. By enforcing clear contracts and abstracting away framework-specific details, Helios allows plugins written for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, or any other framework to coexist and integrate seamlessly within a single host application. This promotes a thriving developer ecosystem, accelerates feature delivery, and enhances maintainability by cleanly separating core and extension logic.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Enable a Third-Party Ecosystem:** Provide a stable and secure foundation for external developers to build and distribute value-adding extensions.
- **Increase Modularity & Maintainability:** Decouple feature development from the core application, allowing independent upgrades, testing, and refactoring.
- **Enhance Customization:** Allow different customers or deployments to enable specific features and workflows without forking the main codebase.
- **Improve Development Velocity:** Empower distributed teams to work on features in parallel with minimal coordination overhead.
- **Optimize Performance:** Support lazy loading of plugins to reduce initial application bundle size and improve load times.

---

## 3. User Personas

- **Core Application Developer:** A developer working on the primary "host" application. They are responsible for integrating the Helios framework, creating the framework-specific adapter, and defining which core services are exposed to plugins via the SDK.
- **Plugin Developer:** A developer (internal or external) building an extension for the host application. They consume the Helios SDK to register routes, add UI elements, and interact with the host application's services. They can build their plugin's UI using the frontend framework of their choice.

---

## 4. Core Principles & Constraints

- **Framework-Agnostic by Design:** The core architecture must not be coupled to any specific frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue). All framework-specific logic must be handled by a swappable **Adapter**.
- **TypeScript-First & Type-Safe:** All contracts (`Manifest`, `Module`, `SDK`) must be defined with TypeScript. The system must leverage static types and runtime validation to ensure safety and provide a superior developer experience.
- **Secure by Default:** Plugins must operate within a sandboxed environment. All interactions with the host application must be mediated through a controlled, well-defined `PluginSDK`. Plugins should not have direct access to the host's internal state or global scope.
- **Declarative Contributions:** Plugins must declare their static contributions (routes, widgets, etc.) in a manifest file, allowing the host to understand a plugin's capabilities before executing any code.
- **Predictable Lifecycle:** Plugins must adhere to a simple, predictable lifecycle (`init`, `mount`, `unmount`) managed by the host, ensuring consistent setup and teardown.

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Plugin Definition Contracts

The system will define two core interfaces that constitute a plugin.

#### FR-1.1: The Plugin Manifest (`PluginManifest`)

A static, declarative JSON object that describes the plugin's metadata and its contributions to the host application.

- **User Story:** As a Plugin Developer, I must define a manifest file for my plugin so the host application can discover, validate, and register it without executing its code.

- **Requirements:**
  The `PluginManifest` interface must include the following properties:
  - `id`: A unique string identifier for the plugin (e.g., `com.company.my-plugin`). **Required**.
  - `name`: A human-readable display name. **Required**.
  - `version`: The semantic version of the plugin (e.g., `1.0.0`). **Required**.
  - `entry`: The URL or path to the plugin's main JavaScript bundle. **Required**.
  - `description`: An optional string describing the plugin's purpose.
  - `author`: An optional string identifying the plugin's author or vendor.
  - `icon`: An optional URL to an icon for the plugin.
  - `routes`: An optional array of `PluginRouteDefinition` objects.
  - `menuItems`: An optional array of `PluginMenuItem` objects.
  - `widgets`: An optional array of `PluginWidgetDefinition` objects.
  - `metadata`: An optional key-value object for arbitrary custom data.

#### FR-1.2: The Plugin Module (`PluginModule`)

A JavaScript module, exported from the `entry` file, that defines the plugin's runtime behavior through lifecycle hooks.

- **User Story:** As a Plugin Developer, I must export an object conforming to the `PluginModule` interface so the host can manage my plugin's runtime lifecycle for initialization, UI mounting, and cleanup.

- **Requirements:**
  The `PluginModule` interface must define the following optional, asynchronous methods:
  - `init(sdk: PluginSDK)`: Called once when the plugin is first loaded. Used for background setup, pre-loading data, or registering event listeners.
  - `mount(sdk: PluginSDK)`: Called when the plugin's UI should be rendered or activated. Used for adding routes, menu items, and other UI components.
  - `unmount()`: Called when the plugin is being deactivated or unloaded. Used to release resources, remove event listeners, and perform cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

### FR-2: Host Interaction (The `PluginSDK`)

The system must provide a single, comprehensive `PluginSDK` object to all lifecycle hooks. This SDK is the sole, controlled interface between a plugin and the host application.

- **User Story:** As a Plugin Developer, I need a well-defined and typed SDK to safely interact with the host application's features, such as navigation, UI services, and data APIs, without accessing internal implementation details.

- **Requirements:**
  The `PluginSDK` will expose the following capabilities, organized by namespaces:
  - `sdk.plugin`: Provides context about the plugin itself.
    - `id: string`: The plugin's unique ID.
    - `manifest: PluginManifest`: A read-only copy of the plugin's manifest.

  - `sdk.routes`: Manages registration of application routes.
    - `add(route: PluginRouteDefinition)`: Adds a new route.
    - `remove(path: string)`: Removes a route by its path.

  - `sdk.menus`: Manages registration of navigation menu items.
    - `addItem(item: PluginMenuItem)`: Adds a new menu item.
    - `removeItem(label: string)`: Removes a menu item by its label.

  - `sdk.widgets`: Manages registration of dashboard widgets.
    - `add(widget: PluginWidgetDefinition)`: Adds a new widget.
    - `remove(id: string)`: Removes a widget by its ID.

  - `sdk.events`: A pub/sub event bus for cross-plugin and host-plugin communication.
    - `on(event: string, handler: Function)`: Subscribes to an event.
    - `off(event: string, handler: Function)`: Unsubscribes from an event.
    - `emit(event: string, payload?: unknown)`: Dispatches an event.

  - `sdk.ui`: Provides access to shared, host-managed UI components.
    - `showModal(content: TComponent, options?: object)`: Displays a modal dialog.
    - `showToast(message: string, type: 'info' | 'success' | ...)`: Displays a short-lived notification.

  - `sdk.services`: Provides access to shared, host-provided application services.
    - `apiClient`: A pre-configured client for making network requests (`get`, `post`, etc.).
    - `auth`: A service to get user information and check permissions (`getUser`, `hasRole`).
    - `storage`: A key-value storage service for persisting plugin data (`get`, `set`, `remove`).

### FR-3: The Plugin Registry

The host application must maintain a `PluginRegistry` that serves as the central control system for managing all plugins.

- **User Story:** As a Core Developer, I need a registry to discover, load, track the state of, and resolve dependencies for all plugins to ensure the application runs in a stable and predictable manner.

- **Requirements:**
  - **Registration:** The registry must provide methods to `register` and `unregister` plugins.
  - **State Management:** The registry must track the lifecycle state of each plugin (e.g., `pending`, `loaded`, `mounted`, `error`).
  - **Discovery:** The registry must be populated by a `PluginLoader` that can fetch plugin manifests from local or remote sources.
  - **Dependency Management:** The registry must be able to resolve dependencies between plugins, including performing a topological sort to determine the correct load order and detecting circular dependencies.
  - **Access:** The registry must provide methods to `get` a specific plugin definition and `getAll` loaded plugins.

### FR-4: Framework Integration Adapter

The system's architecture must be centered on an **Adapter Pattern** to bridge the gap between the agnostic core and the specific frontend framework used by the host application.

- **User Story:** As a Core Developer using React, I need to provide a React-specific adapter so the Helios system knows how to render and unmount a plugin's components using `ReactDOM`.

- **Requirements:**
  - The system must define a `FrameworkAdapter<TComponent>` interface.
  - This interface must require the implementation of at least two methods:
    - `mountComponent(component: TComponent, container: HTMLElement)`: Logic for rendering a plugin's component into a given DOM element.
    - `unmountComponent(container: HTMLElement)`: Logic for cleaning up a rendered component from a DOM element.
  - The host application is responsible for creating and providing an instance of this adapter that is specific to its chosen framework (e.g., `ReactAdapter`, `VueAdapter`).

### FR-5: Type System & Validation

The system must enforce type safety at both compile-time and runtime.

- **User Story:** As a developer, I rely on the system's TypeScript types to prevent common errors, and I expect the system to validate incoming plugin data at runtime to protect the host application from malformed contributions.

- **Requirements:**
  - All public interfaces (`PluginManifest`, `PluginModule`, `PluginSDK`, etc.) must be strongly typed with TypeScript.
  - Generics (`<TComponent>`) must be used for component definitions to maintain framework agnosticism.
  - The host application must perform runtime validation on plugin manifests before loading them. The use of a schema validation library like `zod` is recommended.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1: Security:** Plugin code must be executed in a sandboxed environment (e.g., iframe, Web Worker, or scoped module) to prevent unauthorized access to the host's `window` object or DOM. All interactions must be funneled through the `PluginSDK`.
- **NFR-2: Performance:** The system must support lazy loading of plugins on-demand (e.g., when a route is accessed) to minimize the initial application load time. The registry should facilitate this behavior.
- **NFR-3: Scalability:** The architecture must scale to support hundreds of registered plugins without significant performance degradation. The event bus and shared services should be designed to handle this scale.
- **NFR-4: Developer Experience:** The `PluginSDK` must be fully typed with TSDoc comments to enable autocompletion and documentation for plugin developers. The contracts must be clear and concise.

## 7. Out of Scope (for Version 1.0)

- A visual user interface for a plugin marketplace or store.
- An automated plugin installation or update mechanism from a remote repository.
- A complex, role-based permission system for granting granular access to specific SDK methods.
- Hot module reloading (HMR) for plugins during development.
