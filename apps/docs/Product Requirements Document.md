Got it ✅ — here’s a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** tailored for your documentation site in `apps/docs`, targeting your MVVM-based web framework.
I’ll structure it so it’s easy for you (and an LLM coding agent) to translate into actionable implementation.

# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Name:** Docs Site for MVVM Frontend Framework
**Owner:** \[Your Name]
**Date:** 2025-08-06
**Version:** 1.0

---

## **1. Purpose**

The goal is to create a **high-quality documentation website** for our MVVM-based frontend framework, serving as the **primary knowledge base** for developers. The docs will explain **concepts, APIs, architecture**, and provide **guides, tutorials, and examples**.

The site will live in **`apps/docs`** within our Turborepo and be powered by **Next.js**, using MDX for rich content.

---

## **2. Objectives & Goals**

1. **Educate Developers** — Help new and experienced users understand and adopt the framework quickly.
2. **Provide Quick Reference** — Offer API documentation that is searchable and easy to navigate.
3. **Show Best Practices** — Include guides, tutorials, and example projects to encourage correct usage.
4. **Enhance Adoption** — Present the framework professionally to increase trust and adoption.
5. **Enable Continuous Updates** — Easy to maintain and update in sync with framework releases.

---

## **3. Scope**

The documentation site will cover:

- **Landing Page** — Overview, key features, getting started.
- **Guides** — Conceptual explanations, step-by-step tutorials.
- **API Reference** — Auto-generated or manually curated API docs.
- **Architecture** — How the MVVM design is implemented.
- **Examples** — Code snippets and full working demos.
- **FAQ** — Common issues and resolutions.
- **Changelog** — Framework release notes.
- **Search** — Full-text search across all docs.

## **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance**: Pages load in under 1 second on desktop.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Maintainability**: Content updates should require minimal developer effort.
- **Scalability**: Support adding new pages and sections without breaking structure.

---

## **6. Success Metrics**

- **Time to First Commit**: < 10 minutes for new users after reading Getting Started.
- **Bounce Rate**: < 40% on docs landing page.
- **Search-to-Click Ratio**: > 50%.
- **Framework Adoption Growth**: Track GitHub stars, NPM downloads post-launch.

---

## **7. Deliverables**

- **Docs site skeleton** in `apps/docs`.
- **Configured Next.js + Tailwind + MDX stack**.
- **Initial content**:

  - Landing page
  - Getting Started guide
  - At least 3 guides
  - API Reference placeholder

- **Search integration**.
- **Dark mode** support.
- **Deployed site** (Vercel or Netlify).

---

## **8. Risks & Mitigation**

- **Risk**: Outdated documentation due to rapid framework changes.
  **Mitigation**: Automate API reference generation and add docs update checklist to release process.
- **Risk**: Search index delays.
  **Mitigation**: Use client-side search fallback.
- **Risk**: Overly complex setup for contributors.
  **Mitigation**: Include CONTRIBUTING.md with docs authoring guide.

## **9. Timeline (MVP)**

| Week | Task                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Install dependencies, set up Next.js + Tailwind + MDX    |
| 2    | Implement layout, sidebar, navigation                    |
| 3    | Add initial content (Landing, Getting Started, 3 Guides) |
| 4    | Add search, dark mode, deploy MVP                        |
| 5+   | Expand API reference, examples, FAQ                      |

If you want, I can now **expand this PRD into a “Docs Information Architecture Map”** so the LLM coding agent has a full **page + folder structure blueprint** to generate the site automatically.
Do you want me to prepare that next?
