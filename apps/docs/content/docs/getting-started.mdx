# Getting Started with Web Loom

Web Loom is a production-ready, framework-agnostic UI architecture toolkit inspired by the battle-tested concepts of Prism. Instead of coupling your business logic to React, Angular, or any other framework, Web Loom keeps the MVVM pattern, headless UI behaviors, and plugin architecture in reusable packages under the `@web-loom` scope. This guide distills the mission from the root README, points into the API docs, and helps you launch your first reactive application.

## Philosophy Snapshot

- **Framework-Agnostic First** – Every package works with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript; the UI glue is entirely optional.
- **MVVM + Prism Heritage** – `mvvm-core` brings Commands, CompositeCommands, and observable ViewModels. It mirrors Prism’s DelegateCommand semantics while exposing RxJS `isExecuting$`, `canExecute$`, and `executeError$` streams.
- **Headless Behavior Stack** – `ui-core` offers atomic behaviors (dialogs, lists, forms), `ui-patterns` composes them into higher-level modules, and `design-core` supplies typography and theming.
- **Reactive State & Data** – `store-core` handles local UI state (filters, drawers, toggles), `query-core` manages server-side data with caching and automatic refetch, and `event-bus-core` fills the EventAggregator role for cross-component messaging.
- **Plugin Architecture** – Build extensible apps by registering plugin modules, routes, and adapters without rewiring your core logic.

## Quick Start Checklist

1. **Install the packages you need**

   ```bash
   npm install @web-loom/mvvm-core @web-loom/query-core @web-loom/store-core @web-loom/ui-core @web-loom/ui-patterns @web-loom/event-bus-core @web-loom/design-core rxjs zod
   ```

2. **Create a reactive UI store**

   ```ts
   import { createStore } from '@web-loom/store-core';

   const uiStore = createStore(
     { drawerOpen: false },
     (set) => ({
       toggleDrawer: () => set((state) => ({ ...state, drawerOpen: !state.drawerOpen })),
     }),
   );
   ```

3. **Wrap your domain logic with MVVM**

   Build `BaseModel` + `BaseViewModel` pairs, expose commands, and rely on Zod schemas for validation. MVVM Core wires RxJS for subscriptions and commands so your ViewModels stay testable and framework-agnostic.

4. **Connect to data sources**

   Register endpoints (`defineEndpoint`), subscribe to their state, and let `query-core` refresh stale data on focus/reconnect while deduplicating concurrent fetches.

5. **Compose headless UI behaviors**

   Use `ui-core` behaviors to encapsulate dialogs/forms/lists, stitch them together with `ui-patterns`, and layer in `store-core` state so UI preferences travel with your app.

## Package Highlights

- `@web-loom/mvvm-core` – Models, ViewModels, commands, validation, and Prism-inspired utilities for pure presentation logic.
- `@web-loom/query-core` – Server data fetching with caching, automatic stale-while-revalidate refetches, and manual `refetch`/`invalidate`.
- `@web-loom/store-core` – Tiny, persistence-friendly store for UI parameters and filters; includes LocalStorage and IndexedDB adapters.
- `@web-loom/ui-core` – Atomic, headless behaviors (dialogs, lists, forms) that stay styling-agnostic.
- `@web-loom/ui-patterns` – Composed shell/module UI patterns built on `@web-loom/ui-core` behaviors.
- `@web-loom/event-bus-core` – Typed event aggregation for cross-component coordination, Web Loom’s take on Prism’s EventAggregator.
- `@web-loom/design-core` – Design tokens, typography utilities, and theme management helpers.

Each package ships with detailed API documentation. Start by browsing the sidebar to explore each package's docs for versions, install guidance, and code samples.

## Prism Concepts in a Modern Tooling Stack

Web Loom keeps the intent of Prism alive:

- **Commands** – `mvvm-core`’s `Command`/`CompositeCommand` expose observables and async safety, echoing Prism’s DelegateCommand.
- **Event Bus** – `event-bus-core` replaces Prism’s EventAggregator with typed, observable-friendly APIs, plus an optional lightweight emitter for component-level events.
- **Modules & Plugins** – The plugin core lets you register routes, behaviors, and UI modules just like Prism modules.

## Where to Go Next

- Browse the [Models](/docs/models) and [ViewModels](/docs/viewmodels) docs to dive deeper into each layer.
- Check out the package-specific docs for store-core, query-core, ui-core, plugin-core, and others to see advanced patterns, persistence adapters, and framework integration tips.

Welcome to Web Loom—build resilient, framework-agnostic applications with a toolkit that evolves with you.
