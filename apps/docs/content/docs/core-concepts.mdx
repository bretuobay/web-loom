# Core Concepts of MVVM Core

MVVM Core is designed to help you build scalable, maintainable, and reactive web applications using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. Here are the key concepts:

## 1. Model

A **Model** represents your application's data and business logic. In MVVM Core, models are:

- Typed and validated using Zod schemas
- Reactive: all data, loading, and error states are RxJS observables
- Disposable: implement IDisposable for resource cleanup

Example:

```typescript
import { BaseModel } from '@web-loom/mvvm-core';
import { z } from 'zod';

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string(),
});

class UserModel extends BaseModel<typeof UserSchema> {
  constructor(initialData) {
    super({ initialData, schema: UserSchema });
  }
}
```

## 2. ViewModel

A **ViewModel** acts as a bridge between your UI and the model. It exposes reactive properties and validation errors, and manages UI logic.

- Composes one or more models
- Exposes observables for data, loading, and errors
- Handles validation and resource disposal

Example:

```typescript
import { BaseViewModel } from '@web-loom/mvvm-core';

class UserViewModel extends BaseViewModel<UserModel> {
  constructor(model) {
    super(model);
  }
}
```

## 3. Observables

All state in MVVM Core is managed with RxJS observables:

- `data$`: current model data
- `isLoading$`: loading state
- `error$`: error state
- `validationErrors$`: validation errors

You can subscribe to these in your UI framework for automatic updates.

## 4. Validation

MVVM Core uses Zod for both compile-time and runtime validation:

- Models validate data on set/update
- ViewModels expose validation errors as observables
- Ensures data integrity throughout your app

## 5. Commands

The **Command** pattern encapsulates UI actions:

- Each command exposes `canExecute$` and `isExecuting$` observables
- Useful for buttons, forms, and async actions
- Implements IDisposable for cleanup

Example:

```typescript
import { Command } from '@web-loom/mvvm-core';

const saveCommand = new Command({
  execute: async () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  canExecute: () => true,
});
```

## 6. Observable Collections

`ObservableCollection` provides reactive list management:

- Notifies views of granular changes (add, remove, update)
- Efficient for rendering lists and tables

## 7. Resource Management

All core components implement IDisposable:

- Ensures RxJS subjects and subscriptions are cleaned up
- Prevents memory leaks in long-running apps

MVVM Core is framework-agnostic, so you can use these concepts in React, Angular, Vue, or any other frontend technology.
