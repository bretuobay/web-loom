# Chapter 9: Security Considerations in Plugin Architecture

Security is the **non-negotiable foundation** of any plugin ecosystem.
The moment you allow third-party code to run inside your application, you’re opening the door to:

- Accidental breakage from poorly written code.
- Malicious behavior from compromised or hostile plugins.
- Data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive APIs.

This chapter focuses on designing a **secure plugin architecture** without sacrificing flexibility.
We’ll cover:

1. **Security threat model** — understanding the risks.
2. **Sandboxing and isolation** — containing plugin code.
3. **Permission system design** — controlling what plugins can do.
4. **Content Security Policy (CSP)** integration.
5. **Code validation and signing** — ensuring plugin integrity.

---

## 9.1 Security Threat Model

Before defending a system, we must identify what we’re defending against.

---

### Common Plugin Vulnerabilities

- **DOM injection** — Plugins injecting malicious scripts or altering sensitive UI elements.
- **Data exfiltration** — Sending sensitive data (tokens, user info) to an external server.
- **Resource abuse** — Overusing CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.
- **Privilege escalation** — Accessing SDK features without authorization.
- **Dependency hijacking** — Malicious updates to third-party libraries used inside plugins.

---

### Attack Vectors and Mitigation Strategies

| Attack Vector              | Mitigation                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Arbitrary DOM manipulation | Use Shadow DOM, block `document` access in sandbox |
| Untrusted network requests | Proxy through host API client with validation      |
| Excessive API calls        | Rate limit in SDK services                         |
| Cross-plugin data leaks    | Namespace all storage keys, enforce isolation      |
| Malicious updates          | Require digital signatures, verify checksums       |

---

### Trust Boundaries

Clearly define **what belongs to the host** and **what belongs to the plugin**. The `PluginSDK` is the _only_ official bridge between them.

---

## 9.2 Sandboxing and Isolation

The safest plugin is one that **cannot** affect anything outside its boundaries unless explicitly allowed.

---

### JavaScript Execution Isolation

- **IFrame sandboxing** — Highest isolation; restrict script capabilities using `sandbox` attributes.
- **Web Worker isolation** — Great for background tasks; no DOM access.
- **Virtual Machine contexts** — Node.js `vm` or browser-based interpreters for fully controlled execution.

---

### DOM Access Restrictions

Prevent plugins from querying or modifying host DOM directly:

- Render plugin components into a shadow root.
- Use adapter APIs to handle DOM interactions safely.

---

### Network Request Filtering

Route all network calls through the `sdk.services.apiClient`. This allows:

- Centralized request logging.
- Permission-based URL access.
- Throttling and caching.

---

### File System Access Control

For Electron or Node-enabled environments:

- Disable direct `fs` access.
- Provide a controlled file API inside the SDK.

---

## 9.3 Permission System Design

A **granular permission model** ensures plugins only access what they need.

---

### Granular Permission Model

In the manifest, plugins declare what features they need:

```json
{
  "id": "com.example.analytics",
  "name": "Analytics Plugin",
  "permissions": ["events", "api:read", "storage:global"]
}
```

The host checks these before allowing SDK calls.

---

### Runtime Permission Requests

Some permissions can be requested at runtime (e.g., access to private user data). The host can prompt the user for approval.

---

### User Consent Workflows

Always inform users _why_ a permission is needed and what data will be accessed.

---

### Permission Escalation Prevention

Once loaded, a plugin cannot request higher permissions without reinstallation or admin approval.

---

## 9.4 Content Security Policy Integration

A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** can prevent injection attacks and limit external resource loading.

---

### CSP Configuration for Plugins

- Disallow inline scripts (`script-src 'self'`).
- Whitelist only approved CDN domains.
- Use `object-src 'none'` to block Flash and other binary plugins.

---

### Dynamic Policy Updates

If a plugin needs an external resource, update CSP dynamically after validating the request.

---

### Nonce-Based Script Loading

Attach a random nonce to approved `<script>` tags so injected scripts without the nonce are blocked.

---

### Trusted Types Implementation

Use **Trusted Types** to prevent unsafe DOM injection by enforcing controlled HTML creation.

---

## 9.5 Code Validation and Signing

Verifying the integrity of plugin code before execution is essential for preventing tampering.

---

### Static Code Analysis

Run automated checks for:

- Known vulnerability patterns (e.g., `eval`, direct `innerHTML`).
- Dangerous API usage.
- Excessive resource usage potential.

---

### Digital Signature Verification

Require plugins to be signed by a trusted certificate. The host verifies the signature before loading.

---

### Integrity Checking

Use **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** hashes for remote plugin scripts:

```html
<script src="plugin.js" integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

---

### Malware Detection Strategies

Scan plugin bundles with antivirus/malware detection tools before adding them to the registry.

---

## Key Takeaways

A secure plugin architecture:

1. Treats all plugins as **untrusted by default**.
2. Uses **sandboxing** to contain execution.
3. Enforces a **permission model** for controlled access.
4. Integrates **CSP and Trusted Types** to prevent injection.
5. Verifies plugin code integrity before execution.
