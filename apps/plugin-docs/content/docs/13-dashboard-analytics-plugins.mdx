# Chapter 13: Dashboard and Analytics Plugin Ecosystems

A dashboard is often the **nerve center** of an application—especially for data-driven products like analytics platforms, IoT control centers, or enterprise CRMs.
Unlike e-commerce or CMS ecosystems, dashboard plugin systems focus on **data visualization, real-time updates, and interactive components**.

In this chapter, we’ll explore:

1. **Dashboard plugin architecture** — widget-based systems and extension points.
2. **Case study: Analytics dashboard** — chart and data pipeline plugins.
3. **Data visualization plugins** — custom charts, maps, and reports.
4. **Data source plugins** — connecting to APIs and databases.
5. **User experience considerations** — making dashboards discoverable, performant, and accessible.

---

## 13.1 Dashboard Plugin Architecture

The most common dashboard extension pattern is the **widget-based plugin system**:

- **Widgets** are self-contained UI components that present data or interactive controls.
- Plugins can register one or more widgets using the `sdk.widgets` API.
- The dashboard layout engine decides where and how they appear.

---

### Widget Registration Example

```ts
sdk.widgets.add({
  id: 'sales-overview',
  title: 'Sales Overview',
  render: SalesOverviewWidget,
  size: 'medium',
});
```

Widgets can:

- Fetch data via `sdk.services.apiClient`.
- Listen for global events (e.g., `dashboard:refresh`).
- Push updates to other widgets via the event bus.

---

### Widget Lifecycle

- **Init** — Register widget metadata.
- **Mount** — Render component into a dashboard container.
- **Unmount** — Clean up DOM and unsubscribe from events.

---

## 13.2 Case Study: Analytics Dashboard

Our fictional platform **DataVista** serves real-time analytics to businesses. The dashboard supports:

- Core widgets for traffic, conversions, and revenue.
- Marketplace widgets for industry-specific analytics (e.g., IoT metrics, ad spend reports).

---

### Chart Plugin Implementation

**Manifest**:

```json
{
  "id": "charts.revenue",
  "name": "Revenue Over Time",
  "entry": "/plugins/charts/revenue/index.js",
  "permissions": ["api:read", "ui:dashboard"]
}
```

**Module**:

```ts
export const module: PluginModule = {
  mount(sdk) {
    sdk.widgets.add({
      id: 'revenue-chart',
      title: 'Revenue Over Time',
      render: RevenueChartComponent,
    });
  },
  unmount(sdk) {
    sdk.widgets.remove('revenue-chart');
  },
};
```

---

### Data Pipeline Plugins

Some analytics workflows require **data transformation** before visualization.
For example, a plugin could subscribe to `data:raw` events, process the data, and emit `data:processed` for visualization plugins to consume.

---

## 13.3 Data Visualization Plugins

Visualization plugins extend the platform with new ways to present data:

---

### Chart Library Integration

```ts
sdk.widgets.add({
  id: 'geo-map',
  title: 'Geo Distribution',
  render: GeoMapComponent,
});
```

The plugin could use:

- D3.js for custom visualizations.
- Chart.js, Recharts, or Highcharts for standard chart types.

---

### Custom Visualization Types

- Sankey diagrams for flow tracking.
- Heatmaps for click or usage density.
- Real-time counters for operational dashboards.

---

### Interactive Dashboard Components

- Filter controls that update multiple widgets simultaneously.
- Drill-down interactions that open detailed views via `sdk.routes.add()`.

---

### Mobile-Responsive Designs

Ensure widgets adapt to small screens—especially important for sales teams on the go.

---

## 13.4 Data Source Plugins

Data source plugins extend the dashboard’s connectivity:

---

### API Integration Patterns

**Manifest**:

```json
{
  "id": "datasource.salesforce",
  "name": "Salesforce Data Source",
  "entry": "/plugins/datasource/salesforce/index.js",
  "permissions": ["api:external", "storage:secure"]
}
```

**Module**:

```ts
export const module: PluginModule = {
  init(sdk) {
    sdk.events.on('data:request:salesforce', async (query) => {
      const data = await fetchFromSalesforce(query);
      sdk.events.emit('data:response:salesforce', data);
    });
  },
};
```

---

### Database Connection Plugins

- MySQL or PostgreSQL connectors that pull data directly into widgets.
- Require careful sandboxing to avoid unauthorized queries.

---

### Real-Time Data Streaming

- WebSocket or MQTT connections for live updates.
- Event-driven pipelines that push updates to widgets without page reloads.

---

### Data Transformation Pipelines

- ETL-style plugins that clean and format data for visualization.
- Chainable via the event bus to allow multiple transformations.

---

## 13.5 User Experience Considerations

Even the most powerful dashboard plugins fail if they’re hard to use.

---

### Plugin Discovery and Installation

- A **plugin marketplace** inside the dashboard.
- Search, filter, and preview widgets before installation.

---

### Configuration Interfaces

- Use `sdk.routes.add()` to create a configuration panel for each widget.
- Persist settings in `sdk.services.storage` scoped to the plugin.

---

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy-load widgets that aren’t visible.
- Batch API requests across multiple widgets.

---

### Accessibility Requirements

- Ensure charts have text alternatives.
- Support keyboard navigation for interactive widgets.

---

## Key Takeaways

A dashboard plugin ecosystem:

1. Uses **widgets** as the primary extension point.
2. Supports both **visualization** and **data source** plugins.
3. Encourages **inter-widget communication** via the event bus.
4. Prioritizes **performance, discoverability, and accessibility**.
