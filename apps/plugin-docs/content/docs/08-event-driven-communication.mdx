# Chapter 8: Event-Driven Communication and Inter-Plugin Messaging

So far, we’ve designed the **Plugin SDK** as the official bridge between plugins and the host application.
But what about **plugin-to-plugin communication**?
In a large ecosystem, plugins will inevitably need to:

- React to changes triggered by other plugins.
- Share data without creating direct dependencies.
- Coordinate workflows while remaining loosely coupled.

The solution is an **event-driven communication model**—a system where plugins exchange information through a **central event bus** instead of calling each other’s code directly.

In this chapter, we’ll explore:

1. **Event system architecture** — how the event bus fits into the host.
2. **Inter-plugin communication patterns** — direct, shared state, and service-based.
3. **Asynchronous communication** — handling long-running or delayed events.
4. **Performance considerations** — keeping event handling efficient.
5. **Security and isolation** — ensuring events can’t be abused.

---

## 8.1 Event System Architecture

An event system is essentially a **Pub/Sub (publish/subscribe)** mechanism:

- **Publisher** — emits an event with optional data.
- **Subscriber** — listens for an event and reacts when it’s emitted.
- **Event Bus** — central hub that delivers events to all subscribers.

---

### Event Bus in the SDK

Our `PluginSDK` already includes an event system:

```ts
events: {
  on: (event: string, handler: (payload?: unknown) => void) => void;
  off: (event: string, handler: (payload?: unknown) => void) => void;
  emit: (event: string, payload?: unknown) => void;
};
```

---

### How It Works

1. **Plugin A** calls `sdk.events.emit('cart:updated', { items: 5 })`.
2. The event bus finds all registered listeners for `'cart:updated'`.
3. Each listener is invoked with `{ items: 5 }` as the payload.

---

### Benefits

- **Loose coupling** — Plugins don’t know or care who is listening.
- **Scalability** — New plugins can join the event flow without breaking existing ones.
- **Testability** — Easy to mock and assert in isolation.

---

## 8.2 Inter-Plugin Communication Patterns

While events are the backbone, there are multiple ways plugins can talk to each other.

---

### Direct Message Passing

The simplest approach—plugins send events to each other directly via the event bus.
Example:

```ts
sdk.events.emit('theme:change', { theme: 'dark' });
```

A theme plugin might listen:

```ts
sdk.events.on('theme:change', ({ theme }) => {
  applyTheme(theme);
});
```

---

### Shared State Management

Sometimes, events alone aren’t enough—you need **persistent state** that multiple plugins can read and write.
We handle this with `sdk.services.storage`:

```ts
sdk.services.storage.set('global:theme', 'dark');
```

Plugins can subscribe to a `"theme:change"` event and also query the latest value from storage.

---

### Service-Based Communication

For complex integrations, one plugin can expose an **SDK service** that others can call.
Example:

- Analytics plugin registers `sdk.services.analytics.trackEvent()`.
- Other plugins call it to record events without knowing analytics internals.

---

### Event-Driven Workflows

Combine events with services to chain actions:

1. Form plugin emits `form:submitted`.
2. Validation plugin listens and checks data.
3. API plugin sends data to the server.
4. Notification plugin shows a success toast.

---

## 8.3 Asynchronous Communication

Real-world events aren’t always instant—some require async handling.

---

### Promise-Based APIs

You can wrap event responses in promises for request-reply flows:

```ts
function requestTheme(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    sdk.events.emit('theme:request');
    sdk.events.on('theme:response', resolve);
  });
}
```

---

### Async/Await Patterns

Inside listeners, use `async` functions to handle long-running tasks:

```ts
sdk.events.on('report:generate', async (params) => {
  const data = await fetchReport(params);
  sdk.events.emit('report:ready', data);
});
```

---

### Message Acknowledgment

For critical workflows, plugins can send back acknowledgments to confirm event handling.

---

### Timeout and Error Handling

If no plugin responds within a set time, the host can trigger a fallback:

```ts
setTimeout(() => {
  console.warn('No plugin responded to theme:request');
}, 3000);
```

---

## 8.4 Performance Considerations

Events can become a bottleneck if poorly managed.

---

### Message Throttling and Debouncing

Prevent flooding the event bus with rapid events:

- **Throttle** high-frequency events (e.g., window resize).
- **Debounce** to wait until the last event in a burst (e.g., search input changes).

---

### Memory Management for Event Handlers

Always remove listeners when a plugin is unmounted:

```ts
sdk.events.off('theme:change', handler);
```

---

### Garbage Collection Optimization

Avoid closures that capture large objects—pass only the data you need in payloads.

---

### Performance Monitoring

Track event emission counts and handler execution times to identify slow or spammy plugins.

---

## 8.5 Security and Isolation

Events are an **attack surface** if not properly secured.

---

### Message Validation

The host should validate payloads against a schema before passing them to subscribers.

---

### Cross-Plugin Security

Only allow plugins to emit/listen to events they have **declared in their manifest**. This prevents accidental or malicious interference.

---

### Permission-Based Communication

For sensitive events (e.g., `auth:userData`), require the plugin to have explicit permissions in its manifest before it can subscribe or emit.

---

### Audit Logging

Log all event emissions from plugins for debugging and security analysis.

---

## Key Takeaways

An event-driven architecture for plugins:

1. Keeps communication **loose and scalable**.
2. Supports multiple patterns—direct messages, shared state, services.
3. Handles async workflows gracefully.
4. Maintains performance and security through validation and isolation.
