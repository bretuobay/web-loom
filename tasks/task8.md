Read and understand below the description below of how to integrate these two libraries into the models of and mvvm architecture.
Write a document at the root of the repository called MVVM Integration.md.
to explain how to use the libraries. Use the example of an e-commerce site

packages/query-core/src/QueryCore.ts
and
packages/store-core/src/index.ts
with packages/mvvm-core/src/models/BaseModel.ts

## Integration Notes:

### Model Layer

The **Model** layer is responsible for the application's business logic and data. It directly manages data access, business rules, and validation. This is where your data-centric libraries belong.

- **`query-core`**: Belongs squarely in the Model layer. It's responsible for fetching and caching data from remote servers (your data source).
- **`store-core`**: Also sits in the Model layer. It manages the client-side state, which is part of the application's overall data model.

---

### ViewModel Layer

The **ViewModel** acts as the bridge between the Model and the View. It consumes data from the Model, applies presentation logic, and exposes it to the View through properties and commands. This layer should not directly fetch data but rather request it from the Model.

- **`event-bus-core`**: While it can be used anywhere, the ViewModel is a primary consumer. It listens for events to trigger actions (like telling the Model to refetch data) or to update its state based on what happened elsewhere in the application.

---

### View Layer

The **View** is responsible for the application's UI and presentation. Its only job is to display data exposed by the ViewModel and forward user interactions (like clicks) to the ViewModel's commands. The View should be as "dumb" as possible, containing no business or presentation logic.

None of your core logic libraries should be used directly in the View. The View simply binds to the properties and commands provided by the ViewModel.
